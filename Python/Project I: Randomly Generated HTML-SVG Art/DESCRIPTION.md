This assignment consisted of 3 separate Python projects. The first part was to generate an HTML-SVG file from a defined Circle class. The second part generated a table of random numbers specific to an art configuration class. The third part (a43.py) integrates parts 1 and 2 to generate greeting cards in the form of HTML-SVG pages consisting of the geometric shape classes defined in the previous parts.
For simplicity, only the third part of the assignment is included here. Try using it to generate some art!
